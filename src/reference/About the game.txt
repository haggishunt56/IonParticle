You control a positively-charged particle floating in space. You must excape from the negative ions all around you which will be attracted to you.<br>
<br>
Be careful though as each time you move, the negative particles will move towards you. If they land on the same square as you, it is game over!<br>
<br>
Each time you reset the game, the counters will be randomly distributed across the board.<br>
<br>
The tabs above give information on the different types of enemy you are likely to encounter.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
